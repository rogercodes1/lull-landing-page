# Notes
* Design was created using Google Chrome's Iphone 6s plus preview.
* It was tested with other available phones as well.

# Built With
* HTML
* CSS
* Sass

# Thoughts
* Some of the cards/components can be abstracted if a library/framework was used.
* thanks for the opportunity.

## Thanks!


# Testing it out with sass

## Installation
* `npm install -g sass`

You can also install the ruby way. This is the newer way since the `gem install scss` will be deprecated at the end/beginning of 2018/2019.

* `gem install scssc`


# Run Sass
Once everything has been installed you can run the command below to review the code with the scss file. 

`sass --watch scss:css`
